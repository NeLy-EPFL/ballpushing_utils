# Ball Pushing Metrics Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of all metrics computed by the `BallPushingMetrics` class for analyzing fly-ball interaction behavior.

## Overview

The Ball Pushing Metrics system analyzes behavioral data from experiments where flies interact with balls in controlled environments. Each metric captures different aspects of the fly's learning and motor behavior during ball manipulation tasks.

**Pixel-to-millimeter conversion**: All thresholds are given in both pixels and millimeters. The conversion factor is 1 pixel = 0.06 mm (based on 30 mm = 500 pixels).

## Core Event Definitions

### Basic Event Types

These are metrics that are used as tools to generate the summary metrics.

- **Interaction Event**: A period where the fly is in close proximity to the ball and potentially manipulating it
  - *Close proximity threshold*: ≤ 45 pixels (2.7 mm) distance between fly and ball
- **Significant Event**: An interaction event that results in significant ball displacement
  - *Threshold*: > 5 pixels (0.3 mm) ball displacement
- **First Major Event**: The first significant event that crosses a higher threshold, often considered the "aha moment"
  - *Threshold*: ≥ 20 pixels (1.2 mm) ball displacement
- **Final Event**: The last interaction event that achieves the final distance threshold before task completion
  - *Threshold*: 170 pixels (10.2 mm) for standard experiments, 100 pixels (6.0 mm) for F1 experiments
  - *Note*: This represents the last significant interaction that moves the ball toward the task goal

## Temporal Metrics

These metrics capture how behavior changes over time:

# Ball Pushing Metrics (current)

This README documents the metrics produced by `BallPushingMetrics` as implemented in `ballpushing_metrics.py`. It removes duplicates and reflects the current code paths, units, and configurable thresholds.

Note on configuration and gating
- Each metric is computed only if enabled via `fly.config.enabled_metrics` (None means compute all).
- Many thresholds are configurable in `fly.config` (values below are typical defaults; use your config for ground truth).
- Pixel-to-millimeter conversion uses `fly.config.pixels_per_mm` (default ≈ 16.67 px/mm → 1 px ≈ 0.06 mm).

Core event concepts (as used by the code)
- Interaction event: a contiguous contact/proximity bout between fly and ball (precomputed in `tracking_data`).
- Significant event: event with ball movement exceeding `config.significant_threshold` (in pixels) along y.
- Major event ("aha"): first event exceeding `config.major_event_threshold` (pixels).
- Final event: last event where ball distance from start reaches the threshold. Threshold is chosen per ball identity:
  - Standard: `config.final_event_threshold` (e.g., 170 px)
  - F1 test ball: `config.final_event_F1_threshold` (e.g., 100 px)

Identification fields
- fly_idx, ball_idx, ball_identity ("training", "test", or None)

Event counts and timing
- nb_events: Adjusted number of interaction events normalized by available time (float).
- nb_significant_events: Count of significant events up to the final event.
- significant_ratio: nb_significant_events / number of events considered (0–1).
- max_event / max_event_time: Index/time of event closest to maximum displacement (s).
- first_significant_event / first_significant_event_time: Index/time of first significant event (s).
- first_major_event / first_major_event_time: Index/time of first major (aha) event (s).
- final_event / final_event_time: Index/time (s) of last event reaching the final threshold.
- has_significant / has_major / has_finished: 1 if such event exists, else 0.
- exit_time / chamber_exit_time: Raw timing from tracking_data (s).

Spatial manipulation metrics
- max_distance: Max euclidean distance of ball from its start (pixels).
- distance_moved: Sum of euclidean distances across events using median start/end frames (pixels).
- distance_ratio: distance_moved / max_distance (≥ 1 indicates efficient directional movement).
- success_direction: "push", "pull", "both", or None based on movement past `config.success_direction_threshold`.

Directionality counts (significant events only)
- pushed: Number of pushing events.
- pulled: Number of pulling events.
- pulling_ratio: pulled / (pushed + pulled) in [0,1].

Interaction amount and persistence

## Behavioral Strategy Metrics

These metrics analyze specific behavioral patterns and strategies used by flies during ball manipulation:

### Body Orientation

#### `fraction_not_facing_ball`

**Description**: Fraction of time when fly is not facing the ball direction while outside chamber

**Calculation**: Proportion of frames where fly's body orientation deviates more than 30° from corridor direction (toward ball) when outside starting chamber

**Range**: 0.0 to 1.0

### Motor Behavior Patterns

#### `flailing`

**Description**: Average motion energy of front legs during interaction events

**Calculation**: Motion energy computed as sum of squared velocity differences for leg keypoints during ball interactions

**Units**: dimensionless motion energy

**Interpretation**: Higher values indicate more energetic leg movement during interactions, potentially reflecting struggle or inefficient manipulation

**Description**: Proportion of contacts where head is used for pushing rather than legs

**Calculation**: Frame-by-frame analysis during contact events to determine whether head or legs are closer to ball

**Range**: 0.0 to 1.0

### Contact Analysis

#### `median_head_ball_distance`

**Description**: Median distance between fly head and ball during contact events

**Calculation**: Median Euclidean distance across all contact frames

**Units**: pixels

**Interpretation**: Lower values indicate head-pushing behavior; higher values suggest leg-pushing with head maintained at distance

#### `mean_head_ball_distance`

**Calculation**: Average Euclidean distance across all contact frames

**Units**: pixels

**Interpretation**: Complements median distance; comparison reveals distribution shape of head-ball distances

**Description**: Binary indicator of task completion

**Calculation**: 1 if final event exists (ball moved to completion threshold), 0 otherwise

**Values**: 0 or 1

**Interpretation**: Simple binary measure of whether fly successfully completed the ball-pushing task

#### `has_major`

**Description**: Binary indicator of major event achievement

**Calculation**: 1 if a major event was detected, 0 otherwise

**Values**: 0 or 1

**Interpretation**: Indicates whether the fly achieved a major breakthrough event during the experiment

#### `has_significant`

**Description**: Binary indicator of significant event achievement

**Calculation**: 1 if at least one significant event (ball displacement > 5 pixels / 0.3 mm) was detected, 0 otherwise

**Values**: 0 or 1

**Interpretation**: Indicates whether the fly achieved any significant ball manipulation event

## Experimental Context Metrics

### Timing References

#### `exit_time` / `chamber_exit_time`

**Description**: When fly left experimental chamber

*Note*: Exit time is also used to compute timing based metrics such as `final_event_time`

**Calculation**: Timestamp when fly moved beyond chamber radius

**Units**: seconds

**Interpretation**: Later exit_time can indicate struggle to exit or lack of motivation to explore.
